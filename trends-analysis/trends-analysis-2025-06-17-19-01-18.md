### 2. joby stock

**News Impact Score:** 0/10

**Why Trending:**
Joby Aviation's stock has been on a wild ride in recent weeks, driven by a mix of positive and negative news. The stock surged after the company announced a $250 million investment from Toyota and plans to explore opportunities in Saudi Arabia. However, the stock has also faced some headwinds, with a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst downgrading the stock due to a lack of near-term upside.
