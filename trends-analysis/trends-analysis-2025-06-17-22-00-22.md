### 1. crypto news

**News Impact Score:** 0/10

**Why Trending:**
The topic of crypto news is trending due to several key developments in the cryptocurrency industry. The U.S. Senate is on track to pass a landmark crypto regulation bill, known as the Genius Act, which aims to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins and other digital assets. This has led to increased focus on the impact of this legislation on the crypto market, with Reuters reporting that stablecoins are gaining ground with corporates as the U.S. legislation takes shape. 

Additionally, there is news around major financial institutions like JPMorgan making further inroads into crypto, with the bank filing a trademark for a stablecoin-like token called JPMD. This suggests that traditional finance is increasingly embracing and integrating with the crypto ecosystem.

However, the topic is also trending due to concerns around potential corruption and loosening of rules during the Trump administration, as reported by The Guardian. There are also reports of crypto scams and the decline in the "haven appeal" of digital assets, which are dampening some of the optimism around the industry.

### 2. bitcoin

**News Impact Score:** 0/10

**Why Trending:**
Bitcoin is trending due to a mix of geopolitical tensions and regulatory developments in the cryptocurrency industry.

The price of Bitcoin has been fluctuating in response to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, with the digital asset retreating as the tensions intensified, as reported by Bitcoin.com News and CoinDesk. However, Bitcoin has also shown resilience, with Cointelegraph reporting that the price has stabilized and rallied amid the regional conflicts.

There are also reports of increased adoption and investment in Bitcoin, with Spanish bank BBVA telling its wealthy clients to invest in the cryptocurrency, and DDC Enterprise announcing a $528 million raise to accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy. This suggests growing institutional interest and integration of Bitcoin into traditional finance.

At the same time, there are concerns about potential "rug pulls" and price crashes, as highlighted by Cointelegraph and Forbes. The news also includes reports of Bitcoin-related scams, such as the case in Jasper County, Texas, where deputies recovered $25,000 in cash from a family that had fallen victim to a Bitcoin kiosk scam.
